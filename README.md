# 🔐 Cypher — Cryptography Algorithms Toolkit  
A clean and modular implementation for classic encryption algorithms using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and a simple GUI.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a unified structure for multiple classical ciphers including:

- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**
- **Hill Cipher**
- **Monoalphabetic Cipher**
- **Transposition Cipher**

The goal is to create a reusable, modular, and testable cryptography toolkit with a REST API built using **FastAPI**, and a GUI for demonstration.
